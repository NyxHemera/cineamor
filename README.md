#CineAmor
---
CineAmor was a project I made over Memorial Day weekend as my entry in a competition at General Assembly. The competition was to build an application using the MEAN stack that would allow users to make a list of their favorite movies. I had a few goals with this project:

- Use Angular for the first time.
- Build a single page application with authentication
- Implement an API to pull information on movies
- Provide links to movies on Netflix

The current full application can be viewed [here](http://cineamor.herokuapp.com/#/)

###Issues
---
- Netflix no longer offers their API and I could not find a reasonable alternative. I do have access to Hulu, Amazon, and Google Play links.

###Future Features
---
- Ability to Fork other user's collections
- Ability to Rename Collections
- Movie Ratings
- Movie Reccomendations
- Animated Carosel on Collection Page
